## Predicting hotel rating on booking.com

This is a project prepared for a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sf-booking.

Our goal is to create a model that can predict a hotel's rating. For this purpose we used data from booking.com: we have information about users's reviews on thousands of hotels.


### Here are the steps we've taken to create our model:
1. We clean the data (getting rid of duplicates and some outliers)
2. We create new features
3. We normalise some of the features
4. We get rid of some extra features
5. We create the model

As a result, we have a model that can predict a hotel's rating wigh a good level of accuracy.
